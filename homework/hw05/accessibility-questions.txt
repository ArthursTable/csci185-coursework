Please answer the following accessibility questions:


1. What accessibility corrections did you have to make?
    Missing alt texts 

2. Do you think your website is usable if you turn off the CSS? Why or why not?
    I don't think so, as that'd make it a lot harder to navigate

3. Is your site is tabbable? In other words, without the use of the mouse, are all the links and buttons accessible using the tab key?
    My site is mostly tabbable, however it does not allow for use of buttons.
